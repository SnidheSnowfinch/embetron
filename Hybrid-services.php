        <h2>Hybrid Solar System</h2>
        <p>A Hybrid solar systems combines the best from grid-tied and off-grid solar systems. These systems can either be described as off-grid solar with utility backup power, or grid-tied solar with extra battery storage.</p>
     <p>If you own a grid-tied solar system and drive a vehicle that runs on electricity, you already kind of have a hybrid setup. The electrical vehicle is really just a battery with wheels.</p>

    <h1>Advantage Of Hybrid solar system</h1>
    <ul class="off-text">
        <li>
        Less expensive than off-gird solar systems

        </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- <h6 class="bullet">Less Expensive than</h6> -->
<p>
Hybrid solar systems are less expensive than off-grid solar systems. You don`t really need a backup generator, and the capacity of your battery bank can be downsized. Off-peak electricity from the utility company is cheaper than diesel.
</p>
<ul class="off-text">

        Smart solar holds a lot of promise
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The introduction of hybrid solar systems has opened up for many interesting innovations. New inverters let homeowners take advantage of changes in the utility electricity rates throughout the day.
    </p>
    <p>
    Solar panels happen to output the most electrical power at noon – not long before the price of electricity peaks. Your home and electrical vehicle can be programmed to consume power during off-peak hours (or from your solar panels).
    </p>
    <p>
    Consequently, you can temporarily store whatever excess electricity your solar panels in batteries, and put it on the utility grid when you are paid the most for every kWh.
    </p>
    <p>
    Smart solar holds a lot of promise. The concept will become increasingly important as we transition towards the smart grid in the coming years.

    <h1>Equipment for Hybrid Solar Systems</h1>
    <p>Typical hybrid solar systems are based on the following additional components:</p>
    <ul class="off-text">
        <li>
        Solar Charge Controller        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Solar charge controllers are also known as charge regulators or just battery regulators. The last term is probably the best to describe what this device actually does: Solar battery chargers limit the rate of current being delivered to the battery bank and protect the batteries from overcharging.
    </p>
    <p>
    Good charge controllers are crucial for keeping the batteries healthy, which ensures the lifetime of a battery bank is maximized. If you have a battery-based inverter, chances are that the charge controller is integrated.
    </p>
    <ul class="off-text">
        <li>
        Battery Bank     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Without a battery bank (or a generator) it’ll be lights out by sunset. A battery bank is essentially a group of batteries wired together.
    </p>
    <ul class="off-text">
        <li>
        DC Disconnect Switch     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    AC and DC safety disconnects are required for all solar systems. For off-grid solar systems, one additional DC disconnect is installed between the battery bank and the off-grid inverter. It is used to switch off the current flowing between these components. This is important for maintenance, troubleshooting and protection against electrical fires.
    </p>
    <ul class="off-text">
        <li>
        Battery-Based Grid-Tie Inverter    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Hybrid solar systems utilize batter-based grid-tie inverters. These devices combine can draw electrical power to and from battery banks, as well as synchronize with the utility grid.
    </p>
    <ul class="off-text">
        <li>
        Power Meter   </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    It takes a lot of money and big batteries to prepare for several consecutive days without the sun shining (or access to the grid). This is where backup generators come in.
